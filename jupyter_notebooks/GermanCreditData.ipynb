        "* A company aims to revolutionize its loan qualification process by automating and streamlining the assessment of online loan applications in real-time. The focus is on employing machine learning (ML) models that can accurately predict whether a loan should be approved for an applicant, based on the information provided during the application process. This initiative seeks to expedite the decision-making process, ensuring quick and efficient determination of loan eligibility.\n",
